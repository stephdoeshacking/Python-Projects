# replicate the max() function

for score in student_scores:
  if score > high_score: #this runs through the loop checking every entry to see which score will be the highest
    high_score = score # single = assigns

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {high_score}")

### easy way ###
# min()
# print(max(student_scores))
