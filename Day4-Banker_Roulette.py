# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

num_items = len(names) #Get total number of items in list; len() counts the number of items in the list

random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items-1) #range from the first position to the last; remember the first position starts with 0, so last position will be 1 less

### Option 2 ###

# person_paying = random.choice(names)
